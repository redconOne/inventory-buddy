## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

This project was created with an MVC(Model-View-Controller) architecture outline. We utilized mongoose to assist in creating schemas for our models and ejs to handle our views. Everything is ran from the server.js file in the root directory, with it calling the appropriate resources needed by utilizing our routes.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a good deal about routing and working with the MVC model. I also learned that working in a group can be difficult, especially scheduling meetup times, but that the pool of knowledge from 6 individuals can be astonishingly deep. I was so impressed at the team's ability to come up with new ideas to implement changes, and when the bugs inevitably showed up, our ability to troubleshoot as a team. - Ming Lee
