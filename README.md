## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

This project was created with an MVC(Model-View-Controller) architecture outline. We utilized mongoose to assist in creating schemas for our models and ejs to handle our views. Everything is ran from the server.js file in the root directory, with it calling the appropriate resources needed by utilizing our routes.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a good deal about routing and working with the MVC model. I also learned that working in a group can be difficult, especially scheduling meetup times, but that the pool of knowledge from 6 individuals can be astonishingly deep. I was so impressed at the team's ability to come up with new ideas to implement changes, and when the bugs inevitably showed up, our ability to troubleshoot as a team. - Ming Lee
